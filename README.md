# Java-DFFNN

A java-made deep feed forward neural network. This is an adaptation from the Python-made network (another repository of mine).

Notes:
  * The network is based off of the algorithm and equations outlined in Michel Nielsen's online book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning".
  * All code was written by me as a personal project of converting the Python-made network to another language like Java.
  * This code was written as a Processing script for particular use in self-coded video games as a learning AI. This means the linkage between classes and files isn't quite was a particular Java project would look like, but rather a simpler adaptation. It is an easy change to go from these files to the classic Java format.
  * To convert this to other C-based languages shouldn't be difficult as the main idea was using non-matrix handling libaries to code a neural network.
  
Running Instructions:
  * I highly recommend seeing the readme for my other repository of the Python-made network. It's outlined process is nearly the same as the process to be outlined here.
